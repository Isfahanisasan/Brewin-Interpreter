# Brewin Language Interpreter Projects

Welcome to the Brewin Language Interpreter projects, a comprehensive journey through the development of interpreters for the evolving Brewin programming language.

## Project Overview

### Project 1: Basic Brewin Interpreter
- Developed the initial interpreter for the Brewin language.
- Focused on executing simple arithmetic operations and control flow statements.
- Learned the basics of lexical analysis and syntax parsing in Python.

### Project 2: Enhanced Brewin Interpreter
- Enhanced Brewin interpreter capabilities with functions, boolean operations, and dynamic scoping.
- Integrated complex data types and control structures like recursion and loops.
- Developed a solid understanding of dynamic typing and scope management.

### Project 3: Brewin++ Interpreter
- Introduced advanced features such as first-class functions, lambdas, pass-by-reference, and type coercions.
- Enhanced error handling for semantic and runtime errors.
- Explored functional programming concepts within an interpreted language.

### Project 4: Brewin# Interpreter
- Implemented object-oriented features, including objects and prototypal inheritance.
- Mastered complex concepts such as closures, reference capture, and prototype-based inheritance.
- Demonstrated a deep understanding of OOP in interpreted languages.

## Core Skills and Concepts

- **Advanced Python Programming**: Utilized sophisticated Python features to build and refine the Brewin interpreters.
- **Interpreter Design**: Gained comprehensive knowledge of interpreter mechanisms, including parsing, lexical analysis, and execution.
- **Dynamic Typing and Scoping**: Mastered the implementation of dynamic typing and scoping.
- **Functional Programming**: Effectively managed first-class functions, lambdas, and closures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Acquired extensive knowledge of OOP principles and their application in interpreted languages.
- **Error Handling and Type Coercions**: Skilfully managed various types of errors and implemented type coercion strategies.
- **Prototype-based Inheritance**: Explored and applied prototype-based inheritance, a hallmark of languages like JavaScript.

## Academic Integrity
Adhered to strict standards of academic integrity throughout the project development. The solutions were independently developed, using approved resources appropriately, and avoiding any prohibited practices.

## How to Run the Interpreter Projects
To run any of the Brewin interpreter versions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the respective repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.11 is installed on your system.
3. Run the main interpreter file (e.g., interpreterv4.py for Project 4) in your Python environment.
4. Input Brewin language code or load a Brewin script to see the interpreter in action.
