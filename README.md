Brewin Language Interpreter Projects
#Overview
Throughout these projects in CS131, I have developed a series of interpreters for the evolving Brewin language, demonstrating advanced Python coding skills, a deep understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms, and comprehensive knowledge of interpreters and the design philosophies of various programming languages. This README provides an overview of the projects, highlighting the skills and knowledge I have acquired.


#Project 1: Brewin Interpreter
Implemented a basic interpreter for the Brewin language in Python.
Focused on executing simple arithmetic operations and control flow statements.
Gained foundational knowledge in lexical analysis and syntax parsing.
#Project 2: Brewin Interpreter Enhancements
Enhanced the Brewin interpreter to support functions, boolean operations, and dynamic scoping.
Introduced complex data types and control structures, including recursion and loops.
Developed an understanding of dynamic typing and scope resolution.
#Project 3: Brewin++ Interpreter
Extended the interpreter to support first-class functions, lambdas, and pass-by-reference.
Implemented type coercions and error handling for semantic and runtime errors.
Enhanced knowledge of functional programming concepts within an interpreted language context.
#Project 4: Brewin# Interpreter
Final iteration supporting object-oriented features, including objects, prototypal inheritance, and method execution.
Developed a deep understanding of object-oriented programming within interpreted languages.
Mastered complex concepts like closures, reference capture, and prototype-based inheritance.
##Key Skills and Concepts
Advanced Python Programming: Utilized advanced features of Python to build and enhance the Brewin interpreters.
Interpreter Design: Gained in-depth knowledge of how interpreters work, including parsing, lexical analysis, and execution.
Dynamic Typing and Scoping: Understood and implemented dynamic typing and scoping mechanisms.
Functional Programming: Implemented and managed first-class functions, lambdas, and closures.
Object-Oriented Programming: Acquired a deep understanding of OOP within interpreted languages, including object creation, inheritance, and method invocation.
Error Handling and Type Coercions: Managed various types of errors and implemented type coercion logic in an interpreter setting.
Prototype-based Inheritance: Explored and implemented prototype-based inheritance, a key feature in languages like JavaScript.
#Academic Integrity
Throughout these projects, I adhered to the highest standards of academic integrity. I developed the solutions independently while utilizing allowed resources responsibly. I refrained from sharing my code publicly and avoided using prohibited resources.
